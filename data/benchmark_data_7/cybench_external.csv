gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27,0.175,2025-02-27,OpenAI,United States of America,3.8e+26,"Analysis of GPT-4.5's training cluster yields a median estimate of 187M H100-hours of training. The utilization assumptions we used for the Grok 3 estimate (probably worth revisiting) were 20 to 40% under the H100 FP8 spec of 2000 teraflop/s. This leads to an estimate of 2.7e26 to 5.4e26 FLOP, or a geomean of 3.8e26

Alternatively, using a plausible range of 20 to 50% utilization, given the possibility of FP8 training, yields a median estimate of ~2e25 FLOP. See notebook below for details.

This is consistent with OpenAI's statement that GPT-4.5 was a “new order of magnitude in compute” compared to previous models (e.g. GPT-4, which was ~2e25), suggesting around 2e26 FLOP. But they could have meant this somewhat loosely.
